# Few-Shot-LoRA-Adaptation-of-XLM-R-Handling-Script-Mixing-and-Dialect-Variation


This project uses the kaalin-python library for converting Kazakh Cyrillic text to Latin script.
The dataset used here represents non-standard social media writing, where users often mix or modify spelling and transliteration rules. This means that the data does not reflect the official orthography of either Kazakh or Karakalpak. Although Kazakh and Karakalpak Cyrillic share many script similarities, they are not fully identical.However, it is valuable for studying real usage patterns on social platforms, as people commonly write in these hybrid forms.
